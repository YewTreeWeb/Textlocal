# Textlocal coding challenge

Build a really simple todo app using VueJS. It should be a simple list of todos with a way of adding a new one to the list and ticking/removing completed ones. Don't worry too much about persisting the data but using local storage would be a bonus.

This will be fairly simple and there are lots of examples online, including a Vue example: https://vuejs.org/v2/examples/todomvc.html

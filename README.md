# Textlocal coding challenge

OK, so why not build a really simple todo app using VueJS? I'll leave it as open as that for you but I'm thinking a simple list of todos with a way of adding a new one to the list and ticking/removing completed ones. Don't worry too much about persisting the data but if you want to use local storage, I'd be very impressed.

This will be fairly simple and there are lots of examples online, including a Vue example: https://vuejs.org/v2/examples/todomvc.html
